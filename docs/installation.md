Make sure you have installed [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git).

**Optional**: Install [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).

After installation, clone this repository by typing the following in your terminal.

```

Once you have installed Ruby and Jekyll and cloned the repository, go to the root of the `machine_dashboard` repository and type the following:
